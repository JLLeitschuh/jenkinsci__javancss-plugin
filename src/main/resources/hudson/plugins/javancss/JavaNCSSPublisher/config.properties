pattern.description=\
          This is a file name pattern that can be used to locate the JavaNCSS xml report files \
           (for example with Maven2 use <b>**/target/javancss-raw-report.xml</b>). \
           The path is relative to <a href='ws/'>the module root</a> unless \
           you are using Subversion as SCM and have configured multiple modules, in which case it is \
           relative to the workspace root.<br> \
           JavaNCSS must be configured to generate XML reports for this plugin to function.
